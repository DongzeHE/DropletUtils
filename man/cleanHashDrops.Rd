\usage{
cleanHashDrops(
  x,
  ambient = NULL,
  controls = NULL,
  ...,
  contrib.method = c("sparse", "control"),
  sparse.prop = 0.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric matrix-like object containing counts for each tag (row) in each cell (column).}

\item{ambient}{A numeric vector of length equal to \code{nrow(x)}, containing the relative concentration of each tag in the ambient solution.
Defaults to \code{\link{ambientProfileBimodal}(x)} if not explicitly provided.}

\item{controls}{A vector specifying the rows of \code{x} corresponding to control tags.}

\item{...}{Further arguments to pass to \code{\link{isOutlier}}.}

\item{contrib.method}{String specifying how the ambient contribution should be computed.}

\item{sparse.prop}{Numeric scalar specifying the maximum proportion of tags that should be present per cell.
Passed to \code{\link{ambientContribSparse}} if \code{contrib.method="sparse"}}
}
\value{
A \linkS4class{DataFrame} with one row per column of \code{x}, containing the following fields:
\itemize{
\item \code{ambient.scale}, a numeric field containing the scaling factor for ambient contamination.
\item \code{zero.ambient}, a logical field indicating whether each cell has zero ambient contamination.
\item \code{high.ambient}, a logical field indicating whether each cell has unusually high levels of ambient contamination.
}
The \code{\link{metadata}} of the DataFrame contains \code{ambient}, a numeric vector containing the ambient profile used to estimate \code{ambient.scale}.

If \code{controls} is supplied, the DataFrame also contains:
\itemize{
\item \code{sum.controls}, a numeric field containing the sum of counts for all control features.
\item \code{low.controls}, a logical field indicating whether each cell has unusually low levels of controls.
}

Finally, the DataFrame contains \code{discard}, a logical field indicating whether a column in \code{x} should be discarded.
}
\description{
Clean a count matrix where each row is a tag and each column corresponds to a cell-containing barcode.
}
\details{
We remove cells for which there is no detectable ambient contamination, i.e., \code{ambient.scale} is zero.
We expect non-zero counts for most tags due to the deeply sequenced nature of tag-based data.
If \code{sparse.prop} or more tags have zero counts, this is indicative of a failure in library preparation for that cell.

We also remove cells for which the ambient contamination is unusually high, defined with \code{\link{isOutlier}} on the log-transformed \code{ambient.scale}.
These correspond to droplets that are contaminated by antibody conjugates, which cause all tags to have large counts.
The assumption here is that fewer than \code{sparse.prop} tags geniunely have non-zero abundance in each cell.

Finally, if \code{controls} is specified, we remove cells with unusually low or no coverage of the controls.
This is defined with \code{\link{isOutlier}} on the log-sum count across control features.
Low control coverage is assumed to represent a failure of library preparation. 

By default, we use \code{\link{ambientContribSparse}} to estimate the ambient scaling.
If \code{contrib.method="control"} and \code{controls} is specified, we estimate the scaling with \code{\link{ambientContribControl}} instead.

% In principle, it would be better to filter on the ratio of \code{ambient.scale} as a fraction of \code{colSums(x)}.
% This would better distinguish between antibody conjugates and droplets that just happen to be deeply sequenced,
% as the latter would have a low percentage of counts attributable to ambient contamination.
% In practice, this would also remove real cells that have none of the tags, which may actually be biologically interesting.
